# Neural-Network-Practice
Practice with Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Networks)

1) Constructed 2-2-1 Networks to calculate XOR
2) Constructed an Neural Network topoplogy to recognize coordinates within the unit circle
3) Implemented an ad-hoc learning algorithm to discover the weights in a 2-2-1 network topology for XOR using sigmoid actuator functions
4) Used Gradient Descent Learning Algorithm to teach Neural Network Weights and Biases
5) Experimented with computing gradients of a cost function via backpropagation
